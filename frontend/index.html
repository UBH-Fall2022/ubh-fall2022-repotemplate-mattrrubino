            <p>Water bottles are a significant source of waste. According to the Container Recycling Institute, billions 
            of water bottles end up in landfills each year. This is problematic because plastic is highly resistant to
            biodegradation; bottles accumulate over time, creating an unsustainable condition. We wanted to find a way to
            turn plastic waste into an asset, recycling it to reduce the need for landfills.</p>
            
            <p>For our project, we successfully created 3D printer filament out of water bottles. The water bottles were
            turned into filament by cutting them in a spiral and then drawing them through a modified hot end using a continuous
            motor. Our project also includes a web interface which allows one to view the filament creation and printing process.</p>

            <p>The bottle cutter was built using two ball bearings. The filament generation used a hot end, a continuous motor,
            and a potentiometer to control the motor speed. For the streaming system, an ESP32-CAM was programmed using C++.
            The web frontend was implemented using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and the backend was implemented in Go.</p>

            <p>“Code Red” is a team of two Electrical Engineering majors (Marcus Franscisco and Alex Francisco) and two Computer
            Science majors (Aditya Pandya and Matthew Rubino). Over the years, our projects have featured progressively more
            advanced home protection and security systems. This year, the team pivoted and created a sustainability project known
            as “Code Green” under the alias of “Code Red”. To illustrate the subset of technology involving manufacturing rather than
            emergency systems, the team is now working under the name “Code Blue”.</p>
